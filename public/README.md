# Public Assets

Place your app-wide static assets here. They are served at the site root during development and production (Vite), e.g.:

- `/logo-xiaole.png`
- `/favicon.ico`

For the sidebar logo, the app now tries these sources in order:

1. `/logo-xiaole.png` (preferred)
2. `/logo-xiaole.svg` (fallback, provided)
3. Text fallback "乐"

To use your own PNG logo, simply save it as `frontend/public/logo-xiaole.png` and refresh the page.
